The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user. The java final keyword can be used in many context. Final can be:
variable
method
class

The final keyword can be applied with the variables, a final variable that have no value it is called blank final variable or uninitialized final variable.
It can be initialized in the constructor only. The blank final variable can be static also which will be initialized in the static block only.

Java final variable
If you make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of final variable(It will be constant).
There is a final variable speedlimit, we are going to change the value of this variable,
but It can't be changed because final variable once assigned a value can never be changed.

Java final method
If you make any method as final, you cannot override it.

Java final class
If you make any class as final, you cannot extend it.

Note
Final method is inherited but you cannot override it.
A final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as blank final variable.
If you want to create a variable that is initialized at the time of creating object and once initialized may not be changed, it is useful.
It can be initialized only in constructor.
A static final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as static blank final variable.
It can be initialized only in static block.
Constructor cannot be final as it is never inherited.
