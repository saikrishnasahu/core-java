Usage of Private members :
Private members of a class whether it is a field or method or constructor can not be accessed outside the class.

Inheritance of Private Members :
Private members will not be inherited to sub class.

Note :
1). Class can not be a private except inner classes. Inner classes are nothing but again members of outer class.
    So members of a class (field, method, constructor and inner class) can be private but not the class itself.
2). We canâ€™t create sub classes to that class which has only private constructors.
