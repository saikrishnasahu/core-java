Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private.
Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.

Advantage of Encapsulation in Java
By providing only a setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only.
In other words, you can skip the getter or setter methods.
It provides you the control over the data.
It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.
The encapsulate class is easy to test. So, it is better for unit testing.
The standard IDE's are providing the facility to generate the getters and setters. So, it is easy and fast to create an encapsulated class in Java.
