Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value,
or a variable and another variable.


Java divides the operators into the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Bitwise operators

Java Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

Operator	Name			Description								Example
+			Addition		Adds together two values				x + y
-			Subtraction		Subtracts one value from another		x - y
*			Multiplication	Multiplies two values					x * y
/			Division		Divides one value by another			x / y
%			Modulus			Returns the division remainder			x % y
++			Increment		Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x
--			Decrement		Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x

Java Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
A list of all assignment operators:

Operator	Example	    Same As
=	        x = 5	    x = 5
+=	        x += 3	    x = x + 3
-=	        x -= 3	    x = x - 3
*=	        x *= 3	    x = x * 3
/=	        x /= 3		x = x / 3
%=	        x %= 3		x = x % 3
&=	        x &= 3		x = x & 3
|=	        x |= 3		x = x | 3
^=	        x ^= 3		x = x ^ 3
>>=	        x >>= 3		x = x >> 3
<<=	        x <<= 3		x = x << 3

Java Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

Operator	Name	                    Example
==	        Equal to	                x == y
!=	        Not equal	                x != y
>	        Greater than	            x > y
<	        Less than	                x < y
>=	        Greater than or equal to	x >= y
<=	        Less than or equal to	    x <= y

Java Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:

Operator	Name	    	Description	                                                Example
&& 	        Logical and		Returns true if both statements are true	                x < 5 &&  x < 10
|| 	        Logical or		Returns true if one of the statements is true	            x < 5 || x < 4
!	        Logical not		Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	    !(x < 5 && x < 10)
