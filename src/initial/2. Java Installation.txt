Some PCs might have Java already installed.
To check if you have Java installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Java or type the following in Command Prompt (cmd.exe):
java -version

If Java is installed, you will see something like this (depending on version):
java version "1.8.0_211"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_211-b12)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.211-b12, mixed mode)

You can download Java for free from https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html.

Note: For initial learning, we will write Java code in a text editor. However, it is possible to write Java in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
such as IntelliJ IDEA, Netbeans or Eclipse, which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Java files.
