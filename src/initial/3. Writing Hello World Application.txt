In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.
Let's create our initial Java file, called MyClass.java, which can be done in any text editor.
The file should contain a "Hello World!" message, which is written with the code as shown in MyClass.java.
Save the code in Notepad as "MyClass.java".
Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe), navigate to the directory where you saved your file.
Type "javac MyClass.java":

javac MyClass.java

This will compile your code.
If there are no errors in the code, the command prompt will take you to the next line.
Type "java MyClass" to run the file:

java MyClass

The output should read:

Hello World!
