Understanding of MyClass.java

Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class MyClass.

The name of the java file must match the class name.
When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.

The main Method
The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:

public static void main(String[] args)
Any code inside the main() method will be executed. You don't have to understand the keywords before and after main.
You will get to know them bit by bit.

For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.

System.out.println()
Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen.
