Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the interaction and responsibility of objects.
In these design patterns,the interaction between the objects should be in such a way
that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled.
That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and dependencies.

There are 12 types of structural design patterns:
Chain of Responsibility Pattern
Command Pattern
Interpreter Pattern
Iterator Pattern
Mediator Pattern
Memento Pattern
Observer Pattern
State Pattern
Strategy Pattern
Template Pattern
Visitor Pattern
Null Object
