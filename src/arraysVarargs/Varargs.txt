In JDK 5, Java has included a feature that simplifies the creation of methods that need to take a variable number of arguments.
This feature is called varargs and it is short-form for variable-length arguments.
A method that takes a variable number of arguments is a varargs method.
Prior to JDK 5, variable-length arguments could be handled two ways.
One using overloaded method(one for each) and another put the arguments into an array, and then pass this array to the method.
Both of them are potentially error-prone and require more code. The varargs feature offers a simpler, better option.

The â€¦ syntax tells the compiler that varargs has been used and these arguments should be stored in the array.
The variable is operated on as an array.
Note: A method can have variable length parameters with other parameters too,
but one should ensure that there exists only one varargs parameter that should be written last in the parameter list of the method declaration.

Important points:
Vararg Methods can also be overloaded but overloading may lead to ambiguity.
Prior to JDK 5, variable length arguments could be handled into two ways : One was using overloading, other was using array argument.
There can be only one variable argument in a method.
Variable argument (varargs) must be the last argument.
