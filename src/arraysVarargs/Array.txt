Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
We have now declared a variable that holds an array of strings.
To insert values to it, we can use an array literal - place the values in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:

Access the Elements of an Array
You access an array element by referring to the index number.
Note: Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, etc.

Change an Array Element
To change the value of a specific element, refer to the index number.

Array Length
To find out how many elements an array has, use the length property.

Loop Through an Array
You can loop through the array elements with the for loop, and use the length property to specify how many times the loop should run.

Loop Through an Array with For-Each
There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in arraysVarargs.
The following example outputs all elements in the cars array, using a "for-each" loop.

Multidimensional Arrays
A multidimensional array is an array containing one or more arraysVarargs.
To create a two-dimensional array, add each array within its own set of curly braces.
To access the elements of the myNumbers array, specify two indexes: one for the array, and one for the element inside that array.
We can also use a for loop inside another for loop to get the elements of a two-dimensional array (we still have to point to the two indexes).
